    descriptionShort: "Born after a night in a St Martin St pub: a live piano stuck in my head, carved into a groove that won’t let go.",
    descriptionLong: "The spark for “Your Heart” came after an unplanned night in a St Martin St pub. There was live music, a piano cycling on a simple, stubborn riff, and a table of new faces talking about music until late. Back in the studio I kept only what mattered: that hook under the skin, a round bass, essential percussion and room to breathe. Deep house with a soulful core—movement over loudness, micro-shifts, unexpected hits and a groove that keeps evolving. It’s the memory of that night: strangers who understand each other when music is the common language.",

    descriptionShort: "Born on a late-night platform: city murmur, last train running late, groove held in suspense.",
    descriptionLong: "City Tension” was born late, on a platform, when the city doesn’t sleep but speaks in whispers. The background hum, the buzzing lights, the wait for the last train—everything becomes structure. Back in the studio I kept only what’s needed—tight bass, dry percussion, micro-shifts that push and hold. Urban-minded deep house: no fireworks, just controlled motion, essential hits and breathing space. It’s a snapshot of that moment between leaving and staying, when your inner tempo locks to the city’s noise.",
