      "Born after a night in a St Martin St pub: a live piano stuck in my head, carved into a groove that won’t let go.",  
    descriptionLong:
      "The spark for “Your Heart” came after an unplanned night in a St Martin St pub. There was live music, a piano cycling on a simple, stubborn riff, and a table of new faces talking about music until late. Back in the studio I kept only what mattered: that hook under the skin, a round bass, essential percussion and room to breathe. Deep house with a soulful core—movement over loudness, micro-shifts, unexpected hits and a groove that keeps evolving. It’s the memory of that night: strangers who understand each other when music is the common language.",

    descriptionLong:
      "City Tension was born late, on a platform, when the city doesn’t sleep but speaks in whispers. The background hum, the buzzing lights, the wait for the last train—everything becomes structure. Back in the studio I kept only what’s needed—tight bass, dry percussion, micro-shifts that push and hold. Urban-minded deep house: no fireworks, just controlled motion, essential hits and breathing space. It’s a snapshot of that moment between leaving and staying, when your inner tempo locks to the city’s noise.",

    descriptionLong:
      "The doors open; the air tastes like rain on asphalt. Inside, low lights, bodies tracing time. Neel sees her. She feels him. They don’t speak— they look for each other between dry kicks and short steps. The club (somewhere in Chicago, the District) turns into a suspended hallway where desire doesn’t ask permission—only space. A hand lifts a glass, a smile pauses halfway, and the world slows down for a breath. There’s no promise, no ending—only the courage to stay there, one step closer, until the night decides to hold them in the balance. Night at District doesn’t shout; it whispers. It’s a courtship born from rhythm that leaves you wearing the scent of what might have happened.",

    descriptionShort:
      "3 a.m. — empty roads, windows down, the city breathing slow. Lost in the Feeling is a night drive with no address, just a pulse to follow.",  
    descriptionLong:
      "It’s that hour when the streets belong to you. Sodium lights blur into a soft orange halo, the dashboard glows, and the world shrinks to a lane, a heartbeat, a thought you don’t want to lose. The bass is steady like tires on asphalt; pads drift past like streetlights; a hush of echo sits where words would be. You’re not rushing anywhere— you’re staying in motion because motion feels like truth. Lost in the Feeling is Nick Evan at his most intimate: slow-blooming, soulful, the kind of deep that keeps you company and keeps you honest. No big gestures, no endings—just a quiet surrender to the road until night decides it’s enough.",

  descriptionLong: 
    "Past 2 AM, the city changes shape.\n\nNeon Drizzle was born there — in the thin rain that slides down steel beams, in the warm fog rising from the asphalt, in the hum of trains passing above. It’s deep house carved from shadows: bass moving like a low tide, drums reflecting on wet pavement, melodies glowing softly on the edges of the district.\n\nNo rush. No spotlight. Just the quiet electricity of a city breathing differently when everyone else is asleep.",
