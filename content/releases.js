    descriptionShort: "Born after a night in a St Martin St pub: a live piano stuck in my head, carved into a groove that won’t let go.",
    descriptionLong: "The spark for “Your Heart” came after an unplanned night in a St Martin St pub. There was live music, a piano cycling on a simple, stubborn riff, and a table of new faces talking about music until late. Back in the studio I kept only what mattered: that hook under the skin, a round bass, essential percussion and room to breathe. Deep house with a soulful core—movement over loudness, micro-shifts, unexpected hits and a groove that keeps evolving. It’s the memory of that night: strangers who understand each other when music is the common language.",

    descriptionShort: "Born on a late-night platform: city murmur, last train running late, groove held in suspense.",
    descriptionLong: "City Tension” was born late, on a platform, when the city doesn’t sleep but speaks in whispers. The background hum, the buzzing lights, the wait for the last train—everything becomes structure. Back in the studio I kept only what’s needed—tight bass, dry percussion, micro-shifts that push and hold. Urban-minded deep house: no fireworks, just controlled motion, essential hits and breathing space. It’s a snapshot of that moment between leaving and staying, when your inner tempo locks to the city’s noise.",

    descriptionShort: "Chicago night. A glance, no words. Night at District is sweet tension—desire moving without hurry.",
    descriptionLong: "The doors open; the air tastes like rain on asphalt. Inside, low lights, bodies tracing time. Neel sees her. She feels him. They don’t speak— they look for each other between dry kicks and short steps. The club (somewhere in Chicago, the District) turns into a suspended hallway where desire doesn’t ask permission—only space. A hand lifts a glass, a smile pauses halfway, and the world slows down for a breath. There’s no promise, no ending—only the courage to stay there, one step closer, until the night decides to hold them in the balance. Night at District doesn’t shout; it whispers. It’s a courtship born from rhythm that leaves you wearing the scent of what might have happened.",
