    tagline: "All heart.",
    bioShort: "Nick Evan — the introspective side of BelloSounds. Deep house, urban & soulful. Essential groove, evolving rhythm, no frills.",
    bioLong: "Nick Evan defines the minimal, reflective identity of BelloSounds Records, a creative place conceived by an idea that places groove at the core. His productions merge deep house, urban and soulful into clean fabrics: uncommon rhythmic divisions, essential hits, breathing space. The flow is hypnotic and purposeful, no filler. BelloSounds runs on two complementary voices: Nick Evan, carving sound by subtraction, and Neel Miles, sharper and club-driven. This dialogue shapes a catalog that’s coherent yet ever-evolving. Nick leads creative direction and sound, from instrument choice to mix/master decisions, prioritizing musicality over loudness. Tracks are built to grow over time: breaks as breathing, original rhythmic splits that move the body without force, warm harmonies opening emotional frames. Fewer elements, greater impact, that’s his mark.",
