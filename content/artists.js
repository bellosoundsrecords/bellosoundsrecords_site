    bioShort: "Nick Evan is a sound project born inside BelloSounds Records. It comes from a time—the ’90s and 2000s—that still moves us. It starts again from there: no imitation, it remembers where it came from and looks ahead. No special effects—just presence. Memory becoming future.",
    bioLong: "Nick Evan is a sound project born inside BelloSounds Records. It comes from a time—the ’90s and 2000s—that still moves us. It starts again from there: it doesn’t imitate; it remembers and looks forward, to preserve and pass on that culture. <br>His music begins with a simple idea: a few well-chosen elements and room to breathe. It changes the air through details, not special effects: a step, a pause, a chord that opens. Deep house with urban and soulful touches, made to move without shouting—from the club to the headphones. <br>Memory becoming future.",

    name: "Neel Miles",
    tagline: "Instinctive, cutting grooves that shake the floor.",
    bioShort: "Neel Miles is a signal coming from afar. Born within BelloSounds Records, it travels through the night, across distance and memory. No face, only presence. A sound that crosses through, leaves a trace, then fades. A message that arrives, even if no one is waiting.",
    bioLong: "Neel Miles is a sound project born within BelloSounds Records. His sound moves between deep house, urban grooves, and modern electronic influences, always focused on rhythm and impact. Each production grows from instinct — built on deep basslines, dynamic details, and a tension that evolves over time. Neel Miles embodies the more direct and physical side of the BelloSounds world: less theory, more impulse. A sound designed to move, yet built to be heard. Controlled energy, rhythm as language.",
