    bioShort: "Nick Evan is a sound project born inside BelloSounds Records. It comes from a time—the ’90s and 2000s—that still moves us. It starts again from there: no imitation, it remembers where it came from and looks ahead. No special effects—just presence. Memory becoming future.",
    bioLong: "Nick Evan is a sound project born inside BelloSounds Records. It comes from a time—the ’90s and 2000s—that still moves us. It starts again from there: it doesn’t imitate; it remembers and looks forward, to preserve and pass on that culture. <br>His music begins with a simple idea: a few well-chosen elements and room to breathe. It changes the air through details, not special effects: a step, a pause, a chord that opens. Deep house with urban and soulful touches, made to move without shouting—from the club to the headphones. <br>Memory becoming future.",
