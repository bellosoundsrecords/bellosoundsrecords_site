    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><strong>BelloSounds Records</strong> was born as a place, a creative space, more than a label.
In the ’90s, when everything began, the club was a temple.<br>
Between 1993 and 2003, nights were written on vinyl, and every mix was a drop capable of changing the atmosphere.
Then, that world went silent, not because the passion faded, but because the context changed:<br>
clubs lost their soul, radios lost their curiosity, and music stopped being a collective experience.
Today, BelloSounds closes that circle again.<br>
It gathers what was left unfinished, giving voice to a generation once interrupted, but now reborn, evolved.<br></p>

<p>BelloSounds is a fragment of that time, filtered through the awareness of today.
A bridge between memory and the future.
A sound that doesn’t imitate, but it remembers where it came from.</p>
    <p>More than a label, a creative lab. Two sides, one vision.</p>
